WELCOME TO BLACKJACK 
Blackjack is a casino game with a fast pace. It is the second-most popular card game after poker and is a part of the table
and card games available in every casino in the globe.

RULES
If a player's total value of cards is closer to 21 than the dealer's cards, 
he wins the money staked. If the dealer passes 21 and the player doesn't, 
that is another way to win. Anyone who has BlackJack(21) is automatically the Winner!
